	<h1> Time, Space, and Complexity</h1>
    <p>Time complexity is a fundamental concept in computer science that measures the efficiency of an algorithm in terms of the amount of time it takes to run as a function of the input size. In other words, it quantifies how the execution time of an algorithm increases with the size of the input data. An algorithm is considered efficient if it has a low time complexity, meaning it can handle larger inputs without a significant increase in execution time. Analyzing and optimizing time complexity is crucial for developing algorithms that can solve problems quickly and effectively.</p>
    <p><b>Space Complexity</b> is another critical aspect of algorithm analysis. It refers to the amount of memory or storage space required by an algorithm to solve a problem based on the input size. In terms of notation, space complexity is often denoted by the symbol 'O(n),' where 'n' represents the input size. This notation indicates how the space requirements grow linearly with the input size. Just like minimizing time complexity, optimizing space complexity is essential for creating algorithms that can efficiently manage memory usage, especially when dealing with large datasets.</p>
